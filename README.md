# the-digitizer
Marked Programming Assignment 4 of the "Intermediate Object-Oriented Programming for Unity Games" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera Description

## Description
The big idea is that we can use the DigitizerDigitizer class to convert from strings for digit names (like zero, one, etc.) to the actual numeric digit (like 0, 1, etc.). This is a great problem for a DictionaryDictionary, so that's how you should solve the problem.

You'll need to add code to declare and create an object for your DictionaryDictionary field, add code to the constructor to populate the dictionary with the mappings between the strings for digit names and the corresponding numeric digits (zero through nine, inclusive), and add code to the ConvertWordToDigitConvertWordToDigit method to return the corresponding numeric digit for valid strings for digit names or -1 for invalid digit names (like bob).

You code should handle mixed case strings properly, so the ConvertWordToDigitConvertWordToDigit method should return 1 for strings one, One, oNe, onE, ONe, oNE, and ONE.
